              <p>
                BTS, short for Bangtan Sonyeondan or Bulletproof Boy Scouts, is
                a globally acclaimed South Korean boy band that has taken the
                music industry by storm. Formed by Big Hit Entertainment, the
                group consists of seven members: RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin,
                V, and Jungkook. Debuting in 2013, BTS has since achieved
                unprecedented success, becoming a cultural phenomenon with a
                massive and dedicated fanbase known as the "ARMY." Renowned for
                their dynamic performances, meaningful lyrics, and genre-defying
                music, BTS has transcended language barriers, making a
                significant impact on the global music scene. Their discography
                encompasses a diverse range of genres, from hip-hop to pop, and
                their socially conscious lyrics often address mental health,
                self-love, and social issues.
